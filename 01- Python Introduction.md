The`print()` statement is something that we will be using often to communicate and reflect/echo.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

```
Hello World
```

This is a `print()` function. It prints whatever object that is inside the parentheses `()`.

When we print strings like this, the `print()` removes quotations when it displays the output.
